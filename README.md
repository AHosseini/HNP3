HNP3 is a statistical framework for modeling marked events generated by a set of dependent users. This framework assumes that there are infinite latent patterns underlying the events and each event exhibits one of such events. To this end, HNP3 use nonparametric models fro modeling these latent patterns and use a hierarchical structure to share patterns among users. Hierarchical Dirichlet Point Process (HDPP) and Factorized Gamma Point Process (FGPP) are two variants of HNP3 which are applicable in different scenarios. HDPP is mainly applicable in scenarios where the number of marks is infinite and FGPP is appropriate for modeling datasets with finite number of marks. This is a python implementation of HDPP for modeling content diffusion over social media and a matlab implementation of FGPP for recommendation in online service provides. The HDPP part of this library aims to infer the interests of users by jointly modeling the time and content of messages of users over social media. In order to do so, this library use a nonparametric topic model and a nonparametric point process to jointly model the time and content of messages over social media and uses an efficient online inference algorithm based on sequential monte carlo to infer the latent variables. FGPP uses a scalable variational inference algorithm to learn the preferences of users and offer them the right item at the right time.

## Prerequisites

- Python version 3.x

## Features

-  A coherent generative model for content over social media

-  A novel generative model for learning user preferences and recommendation

- The models manage their complexity by adapting the size of the latent space over time.

- An online algorithm for inference on HDPP and a scalable variational inference algorithm for FGPP.

## Data

The EventRegistry dataset in the data folder is a sample dataset for HDPP model.
The dataset contians the following files:

events.csv: The events sorted in an increasing order of time in the following format:

```
<time> <doc_id> <user_id> <is_dup> <dup_doc_id> <words_len> [word_id:word_count] <ne_len> [ne_id:ne_count]
```

wordmap.pickle: The mapping between the words and their corresponding index. words indices are start from 0.

wordcount.pickle: Number of times each word have occurred. The word are represented by their corresponding index.

If the dataset contains the social relations among the users, then the dataset folder should
contain a file which contains the adjacency list among the users. 
The name of this file should be "adjacency_matrix.pickle" which is a numpy matrix that 
contains the adjacency matrix. 

## Running The Code

- Run the install script using python by ```python setup.py build_ext --inplace```

- Set the Dataset in the "Main" Script

- Run the Main script by ```python main.py MethodName DatasetName```

 where MethodName can be "HNP3" or "DirichletHawkes" or "Hawkes" and DatasetName can be "EventRegistry" or any other 
 dataset which is located in "data" folder. The results will be saved under the results folder
